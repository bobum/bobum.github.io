Dear Mom,

Every time I turn on the news it feels like things are getting worse—violence, division, anger. It can make you wonder if the gospel is really making a difference in this world.

But Jesus taught us to see history differently. He said the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed—the smallest of seeds—yet when it is grown it becomes a tree, and the birds of the air come to nest in its branches (Matt. 13:31–32). He said the kingdom is like leaven that works through the whole lump of dough (Matt. 13:33). Small beginnings, but unstoppable growth.

Isaiah foretold of Christ: *“Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end”* (Isa. 9:7). Habakkuk promised: *“The earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea”* (Hab. 2:14). These aren’t pictures of retreat but of advance.

Jonathan Edwards wrote, *“The church of God is built upon a rock, so it will prevail, and the gates of hell will not overcome it.”* Gates are defensive, not offensive—the church is on the move, storming the gates of darkness.

Mom, I want you to see the hope this gives me. The gospel is not a sinking ship waiting for rescue. It is a kingdom spreading through the world, transforming lives, and one day it will cover the earth.

With love,  
Your son
