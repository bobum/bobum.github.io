##The Unsung Hero: Why Productivity Trumps Efficiency

I was recently sitting in a leadership meeting in Atlanta, and my VP made what came across to me as an odd statement.  "I would rather you chase productivity moreso than efficiency." I cocked my head to the side like the little RCA dog becuase it was curious to me. Aren't they kind of the same thing? Don't you want to be equally both? I was intrigued, and had to do more research. 

In the world of work, "efficiency" and "productivity" are often used interchangeably. While both are crucial for success, it's time to shine a light on why focusing on being productive can be more impactful than solely chasing efficiency.

Efficiency is about doing things in the most economical way, minimizing time, effort, and resources. Think of it as taking the shortest route to a destination. Productivity, on the other hand, is about the volume of meaningful output. It's about getting the right things done. While efficiency is about the process, productivity is about the results.

So, why should you prioritize productivity?

A singular focus on efficiency can sometimes lead to a "get it done" mentality where quality and innovation take a backseat. When the primary goal is to complete tasks as quickly as possible, there's a risk of cutting corners and producing work that doesn't truly move the needle. This can stifle creativity and even lead to burnout.

In contrast, a focus on productivity encourages a results-oriented approach. Productive individuals and teams are motivated by achieving their goals and are more likely to be innovative in their methods. By concentrating on the tasks that deliver the most value, you can make significant strides toward your objectives. This focus on meaningful output often leads to greater job satisfaction and a stronger sense of accomplishment.

Of course, this isn't to say efficiency should be disregarded. The sweet spot is finding a balance where you are not just getting a lot done, but you are getting a lot of the right things done, without unnecessary friction. This might mean investing time upfront in planning and strategy to ensure your efforts are channeled effectively.

Ultimately, while efficiency helps you do things right, productivity ensures you are doing the right things. In a world of endless tasks and to-do lists, focusing on what truly drives results is the key to making a real impact.

What are your thoughts? Do you prioritize productivity or efficiency in your work?
