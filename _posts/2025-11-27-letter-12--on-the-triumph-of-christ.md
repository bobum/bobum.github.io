Dear Mom,

I was thinking about how stories end. Movies, books, even our own lives—we always long for a good ending, a resolution where the struggle is worth it. The Bible tells us history itself is a story, and it doesn’t end in defeat or escape. It ends in Christ’s triumph.

Paul says, *“Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death”* (1 Cor. 15:24–26). Christ is reigning now, subduing His enemies, and one day He will return—not to begin His victory, but to complete it.

Revelation gives us this vision: *“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever”* (Rev. 11:15). Psalm 22 declares: *“All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord, and all the families of the nations shall worship before you”* (Ps. 22:27).

Irenaeus, a pastor in the 2nd century, said: *“Christ shall come at the end of time, when He has subdued all His enemies and given life to all who follow Him.”* From the earliest days, the church saw history not ending in failure, but in Christ’s victory.

Mom, this is where my hope lies. Not in escape from tribulation, but in Christ’s triumph over it. Not in retreat, but in advance. Not in a divided plan, but in one kingdom filling the earth. When He returns, He will not find His Bride hiding in fear, but shining in glory, made ready for the wedding feast.

That is the story I long for both of us to embrace. Christ wins. And in Him, we win too.

With love,  
Your son
