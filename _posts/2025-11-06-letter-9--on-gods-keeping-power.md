Dear Mom,

Life feels uncertain sometimes. We lock our doors, save for the future, do our best to protect what we love—but deep down we know how easily things slip through our fingers. It made me ask: when it comes to salvation, who is holding onto who? Am I holding onto God, or is He holding onto me?

The Bible’s answer gives such peace. Jesus said of His sheep: *“I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand”* (John 10:28–29). Eternal life isn’t temporary life. If Christ gives it, it can’t be lost.

Paul assures us: *“He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ”* (Phil. 1:6). Jude ends his short letter with these words: *“Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy…”* (Jude 24).

Charles Spurgeon once said: *“If heaven depended on my holding tight to Christ, I would despair. But it depends on His hold of me.”* And Sproul echoed it: *“If we could lose our salvation, we would.”*

Mom, this is why I don’t live in fear of slipping through God’s fingers. My salvation is secure not because I am strong, but because He is. And that gives me rest.

With love,  
Your son
