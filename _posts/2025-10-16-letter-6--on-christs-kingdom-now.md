Dear Mom,

I was thinking the other day about how much the world feels unsettled—wars, politics, so much confusion. It can leave us wondering: *Who’s really in charge?* That question made me think of something I know you and I have both heard many times—that Christ’s kingdom is still in the future, that it won’t begin until He comes back to reign on earth.

But when I go back to the Bible, I see something different. After His resurrection Jesus declared, *“All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me”* (Matt. 28:18). Paul wrote, *“He must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet”* (1 Cor. 15:25). That’s present tense—He reigns now. The kingdom is not postponed; it is advancing, even when the world looks dark.

We are not waiting for Jesus to become King. He already is. Colossians says He has “delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son” (Col. 1:13). John greets the churches in Revelation by saying Christ “has made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father” (Rev. 1:6).

Think of it in marriage terms. Scripture calls the Church the Bride of Christ (Eph. 5:25–27; Rev. 19:7). We aren’t an engaged couple waiting decades for the wedding to be real—we are already His, joined to Him, living under His care and authority. To say His reign has not begun is like saying a husband and wife aren’t truly married until long after their vows. What God has joined together, let no man separate. Christ the King and His Bride reign together even now.

Jonathan Edwards once wrote, *“The kingdom of Christ is gradually to prevail against all opposition, till it finally be perfected in the most complete victory.”* Mom, this isn’t wishful thinking—it’s the testimony of Scripture itself.

That means tribulation, as hard as it may be, is not evidence of Christ’s absence but of His reign. He rules even in the fire. And His kingdom will continue to grow until the knowledge of the Lord covers the earth as the waters cover the sea.

Mom, I want to encourage you here. So much teaching looks for escape. But the Bible calls us to endurance under a reigning King who cannot fail. That is the hope I cling to, and I long for you to rest in it with me.

With love,  
Your son
