Dear Mom,

I know at some point you’ll say, “But God gave us free will.” I want to talk about that, because it matters. We both believe people make real choices. The question is: what is the will free to choose?

Let me give you a picture. Imagine a vulture locked in a room. In front of him is a pile of meat and a pile of carrots. Which will he eat? The meat, of course—every time. That’s his nature. He freely chooses, but his choice is bound by what he is.

Now imagine that vulture is miraculously changed into a rabbit. What will he freely choose then? The carrots. His will hasn’t disappeared. His freedom hasn’t disappeared. But his *nature* has been changed, and his choices follow.

That is exactly what the Bible says about us. Jesus said, *“Everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin”* (John 8:34). Paul said, *“None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God”* (Rom. 3:10–11). Our will is real, but it is bound by sin. Left to ourselves, we will always choose what our nature loves—and that is sin.

But when God saves us, He gives us a new heart. Ezekiel says, *“I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you”* (Ezek. 36:26). Paul says, *“If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation”* (2 Cor. 5:17). Only then can we freely choose Him, because He has changed what we love.

John Calvin put it this way: *“Man is said to have free will, not because he has free choice of good and evil, but because he acts voluntarily, and not by compulsion. His choice, however, is corrupt, and enslaved to sin.”*

So yes, we both believe in free will. But free will only brings us to Christ when it has been set free by His Spirit. Otherwise, it is a will bound in sin, like the vulture bound to meat.

Mom, this is why I find such rest in God’s sovereign grace. My salvation doesn’t rest on the strength of my will, but on the power of His transforming work. I want us to talk more about this, because it cuts to the heart of what the gospel really is.

With love,  
Your son
