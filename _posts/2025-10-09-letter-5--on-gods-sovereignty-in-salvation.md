Dear Mom,

You’ve often heard preachers say, “It’s up to you to decide. Choose Christ. Walk the aisle. Pray the prayer.” That kind of language is so common today that we almost assume it’s what the Bible teaches. But have you ever wondered why sermons put so much weight on your choice?

There’s a man you may not know named Charles Finney. He lived in the 1800s, around the same time as Darby, and he changed the way American preachers thought about salvation. Finney taught that revivals could be manufactured with the right methods—anxious benches, altar calls, emotional appeals. He rejected the idea that salvation is a sovereign work of God’s Spirit. In his view, man has the natural ability to turn to God whenever he decides.

Even if you’ve never heard Finney’s name, you’ve heard his teaching echoed by the evangelists and pastors who followed him. That’s why so many modern preachers put the entire weight of salvation on a moment of decision.

But the Bible paints a very different picture. Jesus said, *“All that the Father gives me will come to me… No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him”* (John 6:37, 44). Paul wrote that God *“chose us in him before the foundation of the world”* (Eph. 1:4), and that salvation *“depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy”* (Rom. 9:16). Our hope rests not in our fragile decision, but in God’s eternal decision.

And this is where true assurance is found. If salvation begins with me, I can lose it. If it begins with God, He will finish it. As Paul said, *“He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ”* (Phil. 1:6). Or, as R.C. Sproul put it, *“If we could lose our salvation, we would.”*

This truth isn’t modern—it’s ancient. Augustine, writing in the 4th century, prayed to God: *“Give what you command, and command what you will.”* He knew that apart from God’s grace, we cannot obey or believe. But when God gives the grace, our will is moved to love Him.

Mom, that’s why my confidence rests not in my grip on Christ, but in His grip on me. I want us to talk about this, not to argue, but because I long for both of us to rest in the comfort of God’s sovereign grace.

With love,  
Your son
