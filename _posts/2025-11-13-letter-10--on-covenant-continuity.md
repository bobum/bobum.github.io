Dear Mom,

You’ve always loved the Old Testament stories—Abraham, Joseph, Moses. I’ve thought a lot about how those stories connect to us today. Are they just background, or part of our story too? The more I read, the more I see that they’re tied together in one golden thread: the covenant promises of God, fulfilled in Christ and shared with us.

God promised Abraham: *“In you all the families of the earth shall be blessed”* (Gen. 12:3). Paul explains, *“Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham”* (Gal. 3:7). And again, *“If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to promise”* (Gal. 3:29). Jew and Gentile together inherit the same promises through faith in Christ.

The writer of Hebrews says, *“Christ has obtained a ministry that is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better”* (Heb. 8:6). Not a different covenant for a different people, but the same covenant of grace fulfilled and perfected in Jesus.

Calvin put it beautifully: *“All the saints, from the beginning of the world, have been partakers of the same covenant and truly united to God by the same bond of faith.”*

Mom, this is why I can’t accept the split between Israel and the Church. God doesn’t run two plans of salvation. There is one Shepherd, one flock, one Bride. The whole story of Scripture testifies to this unity.

With love,  
Your son
