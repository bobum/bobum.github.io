Dear Mom,

Lately I’ve been thinking about how much our lives change—jobs, health, friendships, even the routines of daily life. So much feels uncertain. But that made me grateful that God’s love doesn’t shift like that. His love isn’t fragile or temporary. It’s steady, eternal.

That’s why the Bible talks about something called election. Far from being scary, it’s actually a picture of God’s everlasting love. Paul writes that God *“chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ”* (Eph. 1:4–5). Notice those words: *in love*. Election is God setting His love on us before we even existed, before we could do anything good or bad.

Jesus told His disciples, *“You did not choose me, but I chose you”* (John 15:16). And Paul described the unbreakable chain of God’s purpose: *“Those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified”* (Rom. 8:30). From eternity past to eternity future, God’s hand is steady, His plan unshakable.

Augustine said it this way: *“God does not choose us because we believe, but that we may believe.”* Election doesn’t erase faith—it guarantees it. It means our salvation rests not in our weak hands but in His strong grip.

Mom, I know this can be hard to swallow because it cuts across the way we’ve often been taught. But for me, it brings comfort. God didn’t wait for me to make the first move. He loved me first, chose me first, and called me to Himself. My salvation isn’t fragile—it’s rooted in His eternal love.

With love,  
Your son
