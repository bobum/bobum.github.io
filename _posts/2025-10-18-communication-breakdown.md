When Communication Breaks Down on the Way Down

One of the hardest things to watch in any organization is how a good decision turns bad simply because it was poorly communicated.

Executives often make decisions in *ivory towers*—sometimes out of necessity, sometimes out of habit. They operate with limited context, high pressure, and incomplete information. But the fallout doesn’t come from the decision itself; it comes from what happens next.

When communication trickles down the hierarchy, it often fractures.  
- Sometimes middle management is left out of the loop entirely, so the “why” behind the decision never reaches the teams who must live with it.  
- Other times, middle managers are in the room but fail to socialize the decision properly—focusing on *what* will change, not *why* or *how*.  

The result? Confusion, resistance, and cynicism.

Executives need to design inclusion into their decision-making process—bring in the people closest to the work early enough that their insights shape the outcome. But inclusion alone isn’t enough. Once decisions are made, middle management must act as **change champions**, not reluctant messengers. They set the tone. If they communicate with clarity, empathy, and conviction, alignment follows. If they don’t, the organization fragments.

The health of any strategy depends as much on how it’s communicated as on how it’s conceived. Leadership isn’t just about *deciding*—it’s about *connecting*.

I’m not in executive management—*yet*—but I’ve learned how to be a change champion from where I stand. When decisions come down from above, my job isn’t to react; it’s to respond. If I’m calm and cool about change, those around me will follow my lead. Here are five things every middle manager can do to help the organization move forward when executive decisions hit the floor:

1. **Understand before explaining.** Take time to absorb the reasoning behind a decision so you can speak confidently about the *why*, not just the *what*.  
2. **Model composure.** Teams mirror their leaders. Calm, collected energy from you sets the emotional tone for everyone else.  
3. **Translate strategy into impact.** Help your team understand what the decision means for them day-to-day—make it tangible.  
4. **Create safe space for feedback.** Invite honest questions and surface concerns early. It builds trust and reveals blind spots.  
5. **Champion the mission, not just the message.** Whether you agree with the decision or not, embody the organizational intent behind it and help others see the bigger picture.

Change doesn’t always start at the top—it often takes root in the middle, where clarity, trust, and steady leadership matter most.
