## Why I Am A Reformed Christian

In my journey from where I began to where I am in my Christian life, I have always wanted to understand the truth more than anything. I would love to have been an apostle and to have the opportunity to plumb the depths of our faith with Jesus Himself. Since I was born about 2,000 years too late, my journey has taken me back in time as far as I could go in search of a consistent message from Jesus and the Apostles, through time, to me today.

As a child, I was not taught anything about Church history or any Church Fathers, and I believe that this is by design. I believe that if a person honestly and fervently looks back through the hallways of time in search of a consistent message from Jesus, you will find it. You will take a deep and long history lesson to get there, but it's there. I think that this scholarly work in today’s modern evangelical world is frowned upon as elitist and unnecessary, as most Western Christians today revel in their ignorance. *"I just read the Bible and believe what it says"* is the mantra you'll hear. But do you really?

Is your *reading the Bible* just a morning devotional where someone else tells you what to think about a passage most likely taken out of context? Or do you read books about the Scripture instead of reading what it actually says? Do you go back to Scripture to check these people? Are you being told what to think about the Word instead of letting it speak for itself? If you are truly on the quest for truth, and do your honest work, I think it is impossible to not end in the same place that I have ended. That is, Reformed in my theology.

I was brought up in an Arminian, Baptist, premillennial, and dispensational household. If you said those words to my parents or 99% of the people with whom I attended church—they would have no idea of what you were speaking. This is a tragedy and a testament to how theologically illiterate the vast majority of modern “Christians” in America are. My first question in my journey was: *From where did this current understanding come?*

I discovered that dispensationalism wasn’t even a thing until the mid-19th century. This alone was eye-opening to me. How could the Bible—the book that I was told was the Word of God, and that contained the Old Testament which had been around for approximately six thousand years, and the New Testament which had been solidly closed for two thousand of those years—have a framework that was only discovered in the 1850s? I researched and found that British theologian John Darby was widely responsible for spreading my current theology at that time and that I really couldn’t go back in history much further than that to find any tenets of this framework. If I did, I had to do some serious linguistic and hermeneutic hoop-jumping to get it. So how could Christ's Church get it so wrong for so long?

I also discovered that in 1909 the *Scofield Study Bible* had a major impact in the spreading of dispensationalism across America. The *Scofield Study Bible* incorporated extensive footnotes and commentary that explained the dispensationalist understanding of the Bible. By using the King James Version of the Bible, Scofield made dispensationalist teachings accessible to a wider audience and helped to popularize the theological system among American Christians.

The *Scofield Study Bible* also provided a systematic framework for understanding the Bible through the lens of dispensationalism. This made it easier for Christians to interpret the Bible according to dispensationalist principles and to apply those principles to their understanding of history, politics, and culture. Because, let’s face it, dispensationalism and its roundabout series of events aren’t the easiest things to understand. The cross-references in this version of the Bible made dispensationalism spread like wildfire across America.

In addition, the *Scofield Study Bible* was widely read and promoted by influential evangelical leaders and institutions, such as the Moody Bible Institute and the Dallas Theological Seminary. These institutions helped to spread dispensationalist teachings throughout the United States and to make them a central part of American evangelicalism. Overall, the *Scofield Study Bible* played a crucial role in the spread of dispensationalism in the United States, helping to popularize the theological system among American Christians and to shape the way they understood the Bible and the world around them.

Now get this—around the same time that dispensationalism began gaining traction, Darwin’s ideas were sending shockwaves through the scientific community. *On the Origin of Species* (1859) was sparking debates that would reshape science and challenge traditional views of creation. In a different arena, the Christian world was also seeing the rapid spread of a new theological framework—dispensationalism—through the work of John Nelson Darby and, later, C. I. Scofield. The two movements were unrelated in origin, yet their near-parallel rise—each offering a radically different way of seeing the world—struck me as an intriguing historical coincidence, enough to make me pause and take notice. Could it be that if science is going to have a revolution, well then the Church must need one too so as not to be "left behind" (pun intended)?

I was astounded. I couldn’t believe that the words of the Apostles and Jesus Christ Himself could be left completely misunderstood for almost 1,900 years until John Darby and C. I. Scofield came along. This, as well as many things within dispensationalism that didn’t seem right to me as I read on my own, caused my belief in this system of theology to crack.

So I began to seek other writings or thoughts that would help me get further back in time, closer to the Apostles and my Savior. I questioned people who I knew were solid Christians and deep thinkers. Two people in particular steered me down the path I now find myself: my uncle, who was also brought up dispensational and is now Presbyterian, and my pastor, mentor, and friend, who—while not fully Reformed—was very Calvinist in his theology.

I discovered that this 16th-century theologian, John Calvin, was a contemporary of Martin Luther and was heavily influential in the Reformation. And since my preacher mentioned him, and Presbyterians ave been fully integrated into his theological framework ever since the Reformation, I began to dig into his writings and teachings. I uncovered a treasure trove of truth. At once, in the blink of an eye, the entirety of Scripture made consistent and logical sense to me. The troubles I had with dispensationalism and Arminianism that didn’t fit with the Bible I was reading vanished. I had discovered the doctrines of grace.

I dug into Calvin because I didn’t trust him. After all, his writings could only be traced back a few hundred years to 1536, and the Reformation on which it was based was just a few years prior in 1521. This was a giant leap, but I had to get back even further. There had to be a consistent message all the way back to the Apostles. After all, God said that His Word would be preserved through all history. Therefore, one should be able to follow the breadcrumbs through the writings of history. History should tell a consistent story in a consistent way, all the way back to the original Scripture.

What I found was stunning to me. I found the writings of many early Church Fathers contained within Calvin's writings. It was as if Calvin had brought together many previous thoughts into a singule concise framework and released them in a singular document entitled *The Institutes of the Christian Religion*. Now, I've never actually read *The Institutes*, and I'm not sure that I ever will. If I've never read him, I can certainly say I'm not actually a Calvinist. But I have read the Scriptures, and I have come to the same conclusions that he did. So in the end, we're both just Biblicists.

As I looked at who it was that shaped and influenced Calvin's writings in the 1500s, I found the following listed here in reverse chronological order:

- **John Wycliffe (1320s–1384)** — An English theologian and philosopher who criticized the abuses of the Roman Catholic Church and translated the Bible into English, paving the way for the Protestant Reformation. Calvin was influenced by Wycliffe's ideas and theology, particularly Wycliffe's emphasis on the importance of the Bible and the need for it to be translated into vernacular languages so that ordinary people could read and understand it. Calvin also shared Wycliffe's belief in the preeminence of Scripture over the authority of the Church and the need for a return to the teachings of the early Church. *Sola Scriptura*

- **Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109)** — An Italian theologian and philosopher who developed the "ontological argument" for the existence of God and emphasized the importance of faith seeking understanding. Calvin particularly appreciated Anselm's contributions to the understanding of the atonement, specifically Anselm's "satisfaction theory." This theory posits that Christ's death on the cross satisfied the demands of divine justice and provided a sufficient sacrifice to atone for human sin. Calvin quoted Anselm's work, *Cur Deus Homo* (*Why God Became Man*), to support his own theological arguments. *Solus Christus*

- **Augustine of Hippo (4th–5th century AD)** — A 4th-century philosopher and theologian whose writings shaped much of Western Christianity. The basic tenets of Calvinism can be found in the writings of Augustine: predestination, original sin, and the sovereignty of God. *Sola Gratia / Sola Fide / Solus Christus / Sola Scriptura / Soli Deo Gloria*

- **Ambrose of Milan (4th century)** — Bishop of Milan at the time of Augustine's conversion. Introduced Augustine to the works of the Neoplatonists, influencing his understanding of God and spiritual life. *Sola Fide*

- **Athanasius of Alexandria (4th century AD)** — Defender of orthodox Trinitarian theology against the Arian heresy and key figure in the formulation of the Nicene Creed. Calvin quoted him on the Trinity, Christ’s work, and the preservation of orthodoxy. *Solus Christus*

- **Origen of Alexandria (3rd century AD)** — Prolific theologian who advanced Trinitarian thought and scriptural interpretation. Calvin cited him on the nature of God, the Trinity, and the authority of Scripture. *Sola Scriptura*

- **Clement of Alexandria (2nd–3rd century AD)** — Synthesized Christian thought with Greek philosophy, emphasizing education and virtue. Calvin cited him on Christian virtues, the nature of God, and the relationship between faith and reason. *Sola Scriptura / Sola Fide*

- **Tertullian (2nd–3rd century AD)** — Founder of Latin Christianity, defender of orthodoxy, and proponent of scriptural authority. *Sola Scriptura*

- **Irenaeus of Lyons (2nd century AD)** — Defender of the unity of God against Gnosticism, teaching that the knowledge of God is a divine gift. *Soli Deo Gloria*

- **Justin Martyr (c. 100–165 AD)** — Philosopher turned Christian apologist who defended the faith before Roman authorities and emphasized the universality of salvation through Christ. *Sola Fide / Sola Gratia*

- **Polycarp of Smyrna (c. 69–155 AD)** — Disciple of the Apostle John, martyred for the faith. Taught salvation through faith in Christ alone. *Sola Fide / Sola Gratia*

- **Papias of Hierapolis (c. 60–130 AD)** — Disciple of the Apostle John and proponent of bodily resurrection as taught by the Apostles. *Solus Christus*

- **Ignatius of Antioch (c. 35–107 AD)** — Disciple of the Apostle John, martyr, and proclaimer of the centrality of Christ. *Solus Christus*

- **Clement of Rome (c. 30–100 AD)** — Disciple of the Apostle Peter, companion of Paul, and advocate for church unity and scriptural authority. *Sola Scriptura*

Calvin’s writings contained quotes, thoughts, teachings, and principles from all of the above Church Fathers. Calvin stood on the shoulders of giants when he wrote *The Institutes*. The five solas of the Reformation were literally littered in the writings of these Church Fathers. Calvin's TULIP could be pulled out of the very pages of these men's words. There was no new revelation—it was the old story these men had been writing about since they sat with the Apostles. This was a refreshing revelation to me. I felt safe and warm inside the doctrines of grace. God was suddenly huge. The fact that He would choose ME for no reason at all after all my corrupt depravity drove me headlong into profound worship. I loved God more than ever and could not not serve Him.

What I was unable to do was look back on the writings of these titans of theology and find any trace of what we now call dispensationalism. The distinct features of that system—its rigid separation between Israel and the Church, its multiple dispensations, and its specific prophetic timelines—simply are not there. Some early Church Fathers, such as Papias, Justin Martyr, and Irenaeus, did express a form of premillennial hope, but it was a very different thing from Darby’s dispensational framework.

The consistent theological thread I found through their writings was covenantal in nature, not dispensational, and certainly not the prophetic scheme that emerged in the 19th century. None of these men taught anything resembling the modern pre-tribulation rapture doctrine; in their writings, Christ’s return is always a single, visible event at the end of the age, not a secret coming to remove the Church before tribulation—a concept that would not appear until the 19th century with John Nelson Darby.

I was, for the first time in my life, able to trace a singular, consistent, coherent framework of thought, understanding, and writings from my own contemporary thinking, and connect them all the way back through time to the Apostles and Jesus Himself. It was mind-bending and life-changing information. There was no other system of theology that could make the same claim from Scripture alone.

Therefore, and in conclusion, in the words of Martin Luther:

> Unless I am convinced by the testimony of the Scriptures or by clear reason  
> (for I do not trust either in the Pope or in councils alone,  
> since it is well known that they have often erred and contradicted themselves),  
> I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the Word of God.  
> I cannot and will not recant anything,  
> since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience.  
> Here I stand, I can do no other. God help me. Amen.
