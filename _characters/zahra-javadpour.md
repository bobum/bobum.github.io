Zahra Javadpour represents the foundational faith of the Unveiled Trilogy. She is the matriarch of the "Spider’s Web," a clandestine Christian smuggling ring operating out of 1950s Tehran. Her deep, unwavering faith is the driving force behind the Web's dangerous work, dedicated to distributing Bibles in a hostile environment. Zahra's primary role is as a mentor and spiritual guide. She takes in the traumatized, orphaned Maryam Amiri and patiently trains her in the dangerous art of the Web, passing on not just smuggling techniques, but a profound commitment to her mission.

Zahra's influence extends far beyond her active years. While her marriage to the ambitious and ruthless Farid Nassiri is a strategic miscalculation, her spiritual legacy endures through the generations. It is her faith, transmitted through her daughter Laila to her grandson Reza, that provides the moral foundation he will later discover. Crucially, a hidden crucifix—a secret legacy from Zahra—becomes the vital tool that Reza uses to call for help, connecting him to the aging Maryam and the remnants of the Web, proving that Zahra's mission of grace outlived the political turmoil of the region.
