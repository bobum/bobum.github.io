  A passionate and idealistic pilgrim who forms a deep bond with Reza. His theological duels, unwavering faith, and ultimate, selfless sacrifice in Jerusalem serve as the moral and spiritual climax of the entire trilogy.
---
Abel is one of the eleven humanoid pilgrims who land in Iran, and he quickly emerges as a passionate and idealistic leader. He forms a profound bond with Reza ibn Mahmud during their perilous escape and journey toward Jerusalem. Abel is a man of fierce faith, though his beliefs are deeply challenged by the revelation that the pilgrims are not a separate, "quarantined" race, but simply exiled humans. This crisis of identity and belief forces him to redefine his understanding of God's Kingdom, transitioning from an understanding of a "chosen people" to an embrace of universal humanity.

In *The Gardener's War*, Abel returns to Earth to warn Reza of the militant pilgrim faction led by Kael, who seeks to violently impose the Testament faith. Abel becomes a spiritual counter-force to Kael’s "Testament of Swords," engaging in powerful theological duels that ultimately shatter Kael’s messianic certainty. In the climax of the trilogy, Abel is abducted, but his arguments lead to Kael’s profound repentance. In a final, desperate act, Abel sacrifices himself by detonating a localized implosion weapon, neutralizing Levi Bar-Nathan’s bomb plot and providing a definitive, public miracle that vindicates the faith.
