Zephyr is the wise, ancient elder of the pilgrims, an embodiment of profound spiritual depth and history. He is the first of the pilgrims to communicate with Reza ibn Mahmud, forging a proto-language out of theological concepts. Zephyr shares the pilgrims’ ancient belief that they were "quarantined" from Earth to preserve a pure line of faith, and that their return to Jerusalem is a long-prophesied pilgrimage. His calm demeanor and deeply lived faith are instrumental in challenging Reza’s skepticism, beginning the scholar’s transformation.

Throughout the journey, Zephyr acts as the spiritual anchor for his people. While the revelation of their shared humanity causes a crisis of faith for many pilgrims, Zephyr is able to absorb the trauma and continue to witness to the truth. At the end of his life, he chooses to remain on Earth after the other pilgrims depart, his body peacefully returning to the desert. Zephyr's incorruptible remains in the Negev desert become a silent, undeniable miracle that fuels the Testament faith, serving as a powerful testament that transcends political propaganda and provides undeniable evidence of their message.
