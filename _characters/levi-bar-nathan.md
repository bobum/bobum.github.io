  A powerful and cunning Israeli intelligence director. Traumatized by his past, he views the Testament faith as an existential threat to his people. His "baptism" in the desert hardens into a ruthless crusade, making him the primary antagonist of the final book.

Levi Bar-Nathan is a cool, professional intelligence officer who first appears in *Unveiled*, interrogating Reza ibn Mahmud and the pilgrims after their arrival in Israel. He is a pragmatic realist who sees the pilgrims not as a spiritual phenomenon but as a potential foreign threat. Though initially outwitted when Maryam rescues Reza and the pilgrims, his "baptism" in the desert—his close proximity to the otherworldly events—hardens him into a fierce, trauma-informed nationalism. He rises to become a powerful director of a unified Israeli intelligence service.

In *The Gardener's War*, Levi becomes the primary antagonist, convinced that the Testament faith is a "spiritual virus" that will annihilate Jewish identity through assimilation. He launches "Project Shepherd's Crook," a ruthless campaign of covert operations, including the creation of sophisticated Gnostic forgeries, to dismantle the Web of Faith and destroy the Testament movement. Driven to desperation as Reza's message of peace gains global traction, Levi plans a horrific false-flag bombing at the Western Wall, but his plan is thwarted when he is vaporized by Abel's final, selfless sacrifice.
