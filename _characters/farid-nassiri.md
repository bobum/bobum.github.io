---
Farid Nassiri is the primary antagonist of *Web of Faith*, a charismatic, ambitious, and utterly ruthless criminal mastermind. He poses as a pious husband to Zahra Javadpour, marrying her to gain access to her family’s clandestine Christian smuggling network, the "Spider’s Web." Farid is a master manipulator, using the Web as a cover to build his own criminal empire. His cruelty is most evident in his calculated seduction of a young Maryam Amiri, appealing to her ambition and intelligence before publicly humiliating her and siding with his wife. This betrayal is the crucible that transforms Maryam from a naive operative into the hardened, vengeful "Spider of Jerusalem."

Farid’s manipulations continue for decades, including the arrangement of his daughter Laila’s marriage to a brutal associate, Ali Mahmudian. His ambition is boundless, and he is a consistent source of pain and opposition in Maryam's life. Their final confrontation occurs years later in a brutal prison. Farid gloats over his lifelong manipulation of Maryam, only to be killed by her in a final, visceral act of vengeance. He is the original catalyst for Maryam’s journey, a figure who represents the corruption of power and the devastating cost of personal ambition.
