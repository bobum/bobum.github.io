Arash is the silent, lethal force that anchors Maryam's shadow empire. He emerges as her right hand, the physical embodiment of the new, ruthless Web she builds in her own image. Moving with the grace of a hunting cat, Arash is a man of few words and absolute action, his loyalty to Maryam the only law he follows. He cements her authority by executing a treacherous courier without hesitation, an act that solidifies his role as the "fang of the Spider" and sends a clear message to all who would challenge her rule. To the world, he is an unassuming cousin or a faceless guard, but to Maryam, he is the unwavering instrument of her will, the one man she trusts to carry out orders that must never be spoken aloud.

As Maryam's power grows, her relationship with Arash deepens into an intimate, if brutal, affair. Their bond is not one of soft promises but is forged in the shared reality of violence, secrecy, and a profound, unspoken understanding. He becomes her confidante and protector, a constant presence at her side from tense business dealings to the tragic wedding of Laila. His loyalty is ultimately tested when the Web collapses during the revolution. Captured by Farid and the new regime, Arash endures torture but refuses to betray Maryam or her secrets, choosing a defiant death over a single word of treachery and proving that his devotion was the one thread in the Web that could never be broken.
