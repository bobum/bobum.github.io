---
Dr. Sofia Russo is introduced in *The Gardener’s War* as a brilliant archaeologist who provides the academic validation for the burgeoning Testament faith. She quickly forms a deep intellectual and emotional bond with Reza ibn Mahmud, debating scripture and history into the late hours in their fortified Jerusalem library. Sofia is fiercely intelligent and pragmatic, a crucial counterpoint to Reza’s more contemplative nature. Her skills are put to the ultimate test when Levi Bar-Nathan attempts to frame the Testament movement with expertly forged Gnostic texts, requiring Sofia's academic integrity to expose the conspiracy.

When Maryam Amiri, the original "Spider," sacrifices herself to save Sofia, the torch is passed. Sofia embraces her new role as the "New Spider," rebuilding the Web not as a traditional smuggling ring, but as a decentralized, counter-intelligence network designed to fight the war on the battlefield of global information. She provides the strategic direction and resolve that Reza needs, embodying the shift from physical smuggling to intellectual and spiritual defense. Her partnership with Reza solidifies their role as the leaders of the new global faith, culminating in their marriage and the establishment of a peaceful new order.
