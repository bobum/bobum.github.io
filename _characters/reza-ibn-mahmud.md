  A haunted theologian and linguist tasked by the Iranian regime to interrogate the pilgrims. His journey from a man of doubt to the "Witness" and intellectual leader of the Testament faith is the spiritual core of the second and third books.
---
Reza ibn Mahmud is introduced as a man caught between two worlds: a brilliant theologian and linguist serving the hardline Iranian regime, and the secret inheritor of a Christian faith passed down from his grandmother, Zahra. Haunted by this legacy and plagued by spiritual doubt, he is tasked with interrogating the mysterious pilgrims who land in the Dasht-e Kavir, a mission his superiors expect will expose a Western conspiracy. However, his encounters with the pilgrims' wise elder, Zephyr, begin to dismantle his rigid worldview, replacing political suspicion with profound theological curiosity. When the regime resorts to brutality, Reza makes a fateful choice, orchestrating a daring escape and leading the pilgrims into the desert. This act of rebellion sets him on a path of no return, culminating in a devastating spiritual crisis at sea where his lifelong Islamic beliefs are intellectually shattered, leaving him adrift and searching for a truth he can no longer deny.

In the wake of the Vatican's collapse, Reza embraces his new calling as the "Witness," becoming the intellectual and spiritual heart of the burgeoning Testament faith. His translations of the Twelve Testaments and incisive public debates ignite a new global Reformation, but also place him directly in the crosshairs of Levi Bar-Nathan's covert war. Shattered by the sacrifice of his protector, Maryam Amiri, Reza is galvanized by his partner, Sofia Russo, to move from a defensive posture to a bold campaign of "Apostolic Engagement." He transforms from a haunted scholar into a courageous global leader, using his profound intellect and newfound conviction to challenge the world's great philosophies and religions. His journey from a man of doubt to a pillar of faith concludes with him and Sofia overseeing a new generation of missionaries, fulfilling the legacy that began with a whispered prayer and a hidden crucifix.
