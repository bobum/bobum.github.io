---
Kael is a charismatic and militant figure who rises to power among the pilgrim worlds in the wake of the Vatican's collapse. He is convinced that the Testaments provide a divine mandate to "help God" by violently "purifying" the Earthly "temple" and accelerating the Kingdom's arrival. Kael’s "Testament of Swords" ideology represents a dangerous perversion of the faith, placing him in direct conflict with Reza and the idealistic Abel. He arrives on Earth with his "Temple Guard" and performs technological "miracles" of healing and provision, winning fanatical devotion and becoming a formidable antagonist to the peaceful Testament movement.

Kael’s ultimate role is one of profound redemption. In the final act, he abducts Abel, intending to "rescue" him from Reza’s "soft" influence. However, during their time together, Abel engages Kael in a powerful theological duel, systematically dismantling the militaristic interpretation of the Testaments. Shattered by this revelation, Kael realizes the magnitude of his hubris. He agrees to help Abel stop Levi Bar-Nathan’s false-flag bombing, orchestrating the critical technological assistance that allows Abel to neutralize the threat. Kael's repentance is proven by his final, transformative actions, becoming a force for good in the new world.
