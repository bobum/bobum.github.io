Ali Mahmudian is a figure of calculated brutality, more a tool of the plot than a man of complex motivations. He enters the narrative as a business associate of Farid Nassiri, his marriage to Farid's daughter, Laila, in 1976 serving as a cold transaction to cement a criminal alliance. Throughout his marriage, he is defined by a single characteristic: his cruelty. The "years of documented abuse" he inflicts upon Laila establish him as a clear villain, a physical manifestation of the violent and transactional world Farid has built.

His true significance comes to a head following Laila's death in 1987. He transforms from a background antagonist into the singular target of Maryam Amiri's rage and guilt. In a visceral act of personal justice, Maryam hunts him down and brutally murders him in March 1988. This act of vengeance is a turning point for Maryam, fracturing what remains of her network and forcing her into the anonymous refuge of a monastery, effectively ending the era of the "Spider of Jerusalem."
