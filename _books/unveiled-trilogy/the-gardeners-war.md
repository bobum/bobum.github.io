quick_description: |
  Years after the Vatican's collapse, the new Testament faith is a global power, forcing a ruthless intelligence director to launch a covert war to destroy what he sees as a cultural virus. Caught between this secular crusade and a militant pilgrim faction aiming to impose faith by force, the movement's leaders must face a final, sacrificial confrontation in Jerusalem to determine the future of belief itself.

Six years after the Vatican's collapse, the Testament faith has grown into a global movement with Reza ibn Mahmud as its "Witness" and intellectual leader. He is protected by the "Gardener," an aged but formidable Maryam Amiri, who operates a sophisticated new Web of Faith from the shadows. But their explosive growth has been monitored with cold dread by Levi Bar-Nathan, a brilliant Israeli intelligence director who views their message of grace as a "spiritual virus" that will annihilate his people's identity. He initiates a ruthless covert war, framing the movement for a high-profile assassination and forcing them deep underground.

As Levi dismantles their network, Maryam makes the ultimate sacrifice to save her successor, Sofia Russo, leaving Reza exposed and hunted. Now caught in a vise between two zealots—Levi, who wants to eradicate faith, and a militant pilgrim commander named Kael, who wants to impose it by force—Reza and Sofia must fight a new kind of war. The battleground is global, from the debate halls of Cairo to the tunnels beneath Jerusalem, where Levi sets in motion a horrific false-flag attack. In a stunning climax, the trilogy's central question is answered: what does it truly mean to build a kingdom, and what is the final, terrible price of its foundation?
