The story of the Unveiled Trilogy begins in the treacherous back alleys of 1950s Tehran, where a single act of violence sets in motion a decades-spanning saga of espionage and revenge. When her father, a key smuggler for a clandestine Christian network known as the "Spider's Web," is publicly executed, a traumatized fifteen-year-old Maryam Amiri is taken in by the group's matriarch, Zahra Javadpour. Under Zahra's guidance, Maryam is forged into a brilliant operative, mastering the secret routes and codes of a world where faith is contraband. She is sharp, disciplined, and devoted, a rising star in the hidden war for belief.

But Maryamâ€™s carefully constructed life is shattered by the arrival of Farid Nassiri, a charismatic and ruthless criminal mastermind who co-opts the Web for his own empire. He sees in Maryam a reflection of his own ambition and begins a calculated seduction that culminates in a devastating public betrayal. This crucible of humiliation doesn't break Maryam; it hardens her into a legend. Over the next decade, she becomes the feared "Spider of Jerusalem," a pragmatic and lethal operator who must navigate the chaos of the Iranian Revolution, settle old debts with brutal finality, and ultimately confront the man who created her, even if it costs her everything she has left.
