The world changes forever in the desolate salt flats of Iran when a smuggler witnesses the silent descent of an otherworldly craft. Eleven humanoid pilgrims emerge, speaking of prophecy and a desperate need to reach "Yaru-salaam"â€”Jerusalem. To the Iranian regime, they are a threat; to Reza ibn Mahmud, the haunted theologian tasked with their interrogation, they are a terrifying challenge to his deepest beliefs. As he pieces together their ancient theology, a pidgin of Farsi, Hebrew, and scripture, he discovers their story is not a political plot, but a sacred pilgrimage to witness the fulfillment of a prophecy that began at the dawn of time.

When the regime's patience wears thin, Reza makes a choice that brands him a traitor, orchestrating a high-stakes escape across the desert with the pilgrims in tow. This perilous journey becomes a crucible of faith, forcing Reza to confront the irreconcilable contradictions between his own beliefs and the pilgrims' story. But their flight from one prison only leads them into a more sophisticated one, where Israeli intelligence reveals a stunning truth: the pilgrims' entire history is based on a tragic misunderstanding. This revelation sets them on a collision course with a two-thousand-year-old conspiracy at the heart of the Vatican, one so vast it threatens to bring Western civilization to its knees.
