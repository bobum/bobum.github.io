Maryam's father's Bible is the foundational artifact and emotional catalyst of the entire trilogy. A small, battered book with a cover stained and made slick by her father Mahmoud's own blood, it is thrust into her hands in the moments after his public execution. More than just scripture, it becomes the physical embodiment of his last command—"Continue what I started. Do not be afraid"—and the anchor for Maryam's lifelong vow. It remains her most sacred possession and a source of private torment and conviction, traveling with her from her first mission, through her ruthless transformation into the feared "Spider of Jerusalem," and into her final redemption as Sister Mariam, representing the unbroken and defining thread of faith, vengeance, and legacy that drives her entire story.
