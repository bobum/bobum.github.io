The Seder of Light is a syncretic religious ritual that emerged organically within the Testament Faith's Israeli cells. It represents the "infection" of Jewish tradition with the Web's "New Covenant" theology, a phenomenon Levi Bar-Nathan viewed as a profound spiritual threat.

Practitioners of the Seder of Light adapt the traditional Jewish Passover Seder, incorporating elements of the Christian Eucharist. During the ceremony, a menorah and matzah are present, but the central act involves sharing a cup of wine and reciting the words of institution: "This cup is the new covenant in my blood."

Led by high-profile converts like Professor Arnon Ben-David, this ritual was seen by Levi as an act of "spiritual assimilation" and erasure, as it taught Jewish children to participate in Christian sacraments. The existence of the Seder of Light was one of the primary catalysts for Levi's decision to launch a covert war against the Web.
