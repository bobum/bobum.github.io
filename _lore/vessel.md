The alien vessel is a craft of elegant and otherworldly design, appearing as a smooth, seamless domed triangle whose hull pulses with an internal, phosphorescent light. Capable of silent, graceful flight and interstellar travel by "folding" space, it is controlled by a small, handheld "seed" interface; without this key, the technologically advanced ship is merely an inert and impenetrable shell. Its surprise landing in the Iranian desert serves as the inciting incident for the entire trilogy, immediately becoming a coveted prize for global intelligence agencies and the primary means of transport for the pilgrims' mission of exile and return.
