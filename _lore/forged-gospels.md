The Forged Gospels were a set of sophisticated, counterfeit scriptures created by Levi Bar-Nathan as the centerpiece of his "Project Shepherd's Crook." Designed to discredit and dismantle the Testament Faith, these documents were not crude forgeries but masterpieces of deception, crafted with period-correct inks and artificially aged papyrus.

The texts themselves were a form of "theological poison," twisting the core message of the Web from one of inclusive, sovereign grace into a hard, exclusive doctrine of purity and judgment. Key passages, like the "Book of the Spider," were designed to frame Maryam Amiri as a manipulative cult leader.

Levi's strategy was to "leak" these gospels to the world, creating chaos and fracturing the Web's authority by introducing a competing, more violent narrative. The plot culminated in a high-stakes authentication tribunal in Cairo, where Sofia Russo was tasked with proving they were fakes. The existence of these gospels is a testament to Levi's belief that a story can kill a nation more thoroughly than any bomb.
