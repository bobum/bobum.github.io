The Seed is a small, iridescent, handheld device that serves as the primary interface and command key for the pilgrim vessel, utilizing advanced quantum entanglement to communicate with and summon the ship across vast distances. Initially presented as a tool of control and travel, its function is tragically and heroically transformed in the trilogy's final act. Reprogrammed by Kael's repentant engineers, the Seed is converted from a communication tool into a localized, suicidal implosion weapon. In a definitive act of selfless sacrifice, Abel activates the device while embracing Levi Bar-Nathan, vaporizing them both and neutralizing the bomb threat at the Western Wall, thus evolving the Seed from a simple key into the ultimate instrument of spiritual victory.
