The *Crucifix Beacon* is a small, worn cross on a thin chain, an unassuming religious object that doubles as a clandestine communication device for the Spider's Web. Passed down as a secret family heirloom from the original matriarch, Zahra, to her daughter Laila and then to her grandson Reza, it embodies the fusion of faith and espionage that defines the network. A hidden latch on the back of the crucifix conceals a short-range transmitter, which, when activated with a specific coded sequence, sends out a powerful distress signal to the Web's operatives. More than a tool, it is a symbol of last resort and a physical link connecting three generations, used by Maryam to trigger a prison break and later by Reza to summon the Spider's network, proving to be the one of the most pivotal devices in the entire trilogy.
