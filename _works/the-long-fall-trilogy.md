  As the world’s great powers crumble, survival becomes a brutal currency. The Long Fall Trilogy plunges readers into a collapsing order where fractured alliances, desperate gambles, and the ghosts of past choices decide who will rise—and who will be swept away.

  When the pillars of civilization crack, the fall is swift—and merciless. In The Long Fall Trilogy, political intrigue collides with raw human endurance in a race against the tide of history itself.
