  The *Unveiled* trilogy takes you from the back alleys of Tehran to the contested streets of Jerusalem where three lives are bound by a murdered fisherman’s Bible and the dangerous truths it carries. Maryam Amiri’s smuggling network, Reza ibn Mahmud’s covert alliances, and Levi Bar-Nathan’s bid for control collide when an alien vessel lands in Iran’s desert, drawing spies, militias, and prophets into a single storm. As faith is weaponized and loyalty tested, each must decide whether their cause is worth the cost it demands.
  The *Unveiled* trilogy is a historic, geopolitical thriller steeped in theological tension, where smuggled Bibles ignite revolutions, an alien pilgrim challenges centuries of prophecy, and Jerusalem becomes the chessboard for a final bid for power. From the hidden print shops of the Spider’s Web to the windswept salt flats beneath an unearthly vessel, and into war rooms where faith and ambition are indistinguishable, the trilogy traces how a single encounter can reshape nations. Each choice, from whispered prayers to acts of war, forces the question: whose truth will survive?

From the blood-soaked Bible of a martyred fisherman in 1950s Iran, a legacy of faith and rebellion is born, setting in motion a decades-spanning saga of espionage, political upheaval, and spiritual warfare. The story begins with Maryam Amiri, a young girl forged by tragedy into the legendary smuggler "The Spider of Jerusalem," whose network risks everything to keep a flicker of truth alive. Her path becomes inextricably linked with that of Reza ibn Mahmud, a brilliant theologian haunted by a secret Christian heritage, and Levi Bar-Nathan, an Israeli intelligence chief driven by a fierce, protective nationalism. Their lives, and the clandestine worlds they inhabit, are irrevocably shattered when eleven humanoid pilgrims arrive in the Iranian desert, their otherworldly craft and ancient message of "Yaru-salaam" igniting a global firestorm. This single event transforms their personal struggles into a geopolitical crisis, forcing an uneasy alliance that will challenge the foundations of their beliefs.

As Reza desperately guides the pilgrims toward a prophesied destiny in Jerusalem, he uncovers a conspiracy that reaches the very heart of Western religion, threatening to collapse centuries of tradition. The fallout from this revelation propels the burgeoning Testament faith into a global movement, with Reza as its reluctant public face and the aging Maryam as its unseen protector. Caught between Levi’s ruthless campaign to neutralize what he sees as a cultural threat and the rise of a militant pilgrim faction aiming to impose faith by force, Reza and his allies must navigate a treacherous landscape where miracles are real, martyrdom is a strategy, and the battle for the future is fought not just in war rooms, but in the depths of the human soul. The trilogy culminates in a final, desperate confrontation in Jerusalem, where the sacrifices of the few will determine the fate of generations on Earth and across the stars.
