The *Unveiled* trilogy takes you from the back alleys of Tehran to the contested streets of Jerusalem where three lives are bound by a murdered fisherman’s Bible and the dangerous truths it carries. Maryam Amiri’s smuggling network, Reza ibn Mahmud’s covert alliances, and Levi Bar-Nathan’s bid for control collide when an alien vessel lands in Iran’s desert, drawing spies, militias, and prophets into a single storm. As faith is weaponized and loyalty tested, each must decide whether their cause is worth the cost it demands.

The *Unveiled* trilogy is a historic, geopolitical thriller steeped in theological tension, where smuggled Bibles ignite revolutions, an alien pilgrim challenges centuries of prophecy, and Jerusalem becomes the chessboard for a final bid for power. From the hidden print shops of the Spider’s Web to the windswept salt flats beneath an unearthly vessel, and into war rooms where faith and ambition are indistinguishable, the trilogy traces how a single encounter can reshape nations. Each choice, from whispered prayers to acts of war, forces the question: whose truth will survive?
