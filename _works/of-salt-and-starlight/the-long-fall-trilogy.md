  In the wake of the storm that shattered the skies, the sea chooses its own kings. Survival will belong to those who can take it—and keep it.

First, in the *Of Salt and Starlight* Saga. When a solar storm cripples Earth’s orbital infrastructure, the collapse cascades into oceans and ports, where power shifts to those who can command the seas. Captain Corbin Shaw’s crew, bound by old loyalties and new grudges, is drawn into a desperate race through storm-lashed skies and pirate-controlled waters to find the remnants of technology that could save—or doom—the planet. In a world where every harbor hides a trap, the line between salvage and theft becomes a choice between survival and surrender.

This is a maritime odyssey set against the slow drowning of the world, where skyships duel over flooded cities and alliances are bought with stolen cargo. From the lightning-wracked launch of Skyfire to the lawless freeports of the equator, the trilogy charts a fall measured not in years, but in miles lost to the sea. Every voyage risks more than the crew’s lives—it risks handing the last threads of the old world to those eager to burn them.
