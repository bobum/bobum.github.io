description: |
  When the skies turn hostile and empires retreat to the sea, outlaw captains and corporate fleets fight to rule the trade winds. Salt & Sovereigns charts the rise of a reluctant pirate hero who raids AetherCorp’s lifeblood, topples the dream of a reborn Panama Canal, and forges a code that could unite—or doom—the free seas.

  In a world rebuilt on sails and scarcity, freedom has a price and power rides the tide. Across three sweeping adventures, Salt & Sovereigns follows daring raids, knife-edge diplomacy, and the birth of a confederation that dares to stand against a ruthless corporate empire.
