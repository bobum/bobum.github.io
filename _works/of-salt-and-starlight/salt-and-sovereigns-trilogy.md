  On seas where salt buys crowns, every voyage is a bid for a kingdom. The wind will decide who wears it.

Second, in the *Of Salt and Starlight* saga. With the old powers drowned or dethroned, the high seas have become the true throne rooms of the age. In the shadow of a ruthless corporate cartel that owns the Panama Canal, captains race for dominance over the salt lanes—ancient galleon silhouettes reborn with cutting-edge sail technology. Alliances form and fracture as every crossing becomes a wager for sovereignty, and the tides carry rumors of a vessel built to outrun death itself.

This is a world where the map is redrawn by wind and keel, and the right to rule is earned one broadside at a time. From smuggler strongholds in the Caribbean to fortified trade citadels on distant coasts, the trilogy charts a war for control over the arteries of the world’s commerce. Every sail on the horizon could mean profit, plunder, or the spark that ignites an empire’s fall.
