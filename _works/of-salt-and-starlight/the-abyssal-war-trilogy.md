description: |
  Beneath storm-churned seas, the deadliest warships in history stalk the depths. The Abyssal War follows an aging Admiral Corbin Shaw as he commands the legendary Void Kraken in a final campaign—one that will decide control of the oceans and the fate of every free port left in the world.

  When the war moves into the deep, there is no sanctuary—only predators and prey. In The Abyssal War, alliances fracture, abyssal superweapons clash, and a grizzled commander must gamble everything on one last, impossible voyage.
