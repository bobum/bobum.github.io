  In the deep, no flag flies for long. Victory belongs to whoever surfaces last.
back_cover_text: |
  Last, in the *Of Salt and Starlight* saga. Beneath the turquoise skin of the Caribbean lies a shadow—deep trenches where nations hide weapons they swore they destroyed. When those secrets stir, Captain Corbin Shaw, older and carrying the weight of too many victories, is drawn into a conflict that will not stay on the surface. Rival fleets hunt him above, while in the depths, machines and monsters move to claim the black silence as their own.

  This is a war waged in crushing darkness, where sonar becomes prophecy and a single torpedo can rewrite borders. At its heart is *The Void Kraken*—a prototype warship built to dive deeper, run faster, and strike harder than anything afloat. From stealth runs through volcanic vents to battles lit only by bioluminescence and muzzle flash, the trilogy plunges into a theater where escape means outthinking not just the enemy, but the ocean itself. The deeper the fight goes, the more it becomes clear—some wars can only be won by those willing to disappear beneath the waves.
